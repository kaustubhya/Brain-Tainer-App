Hello All,
I started doing Android Developement a few months back and till now I was only sharing my learnings on 
Twitter and this project was stored locally on my system but now I have shared the code on Github with comments to help you more.

Description - This project is a basic Arithmetic addition app in which you have 30 seconds to solve as many questions as you want, there is a timer and a score counter
              Each question has 4 options.
              
             Here I used Android buttons for Options and other actions like GO button
             Text Views and Layouts like Grid and Constraint Layout, and a CountDown Timer
             
             Rest all I hope would be clear from the code.
